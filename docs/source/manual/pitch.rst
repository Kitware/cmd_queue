Elevator Pitch
--------------

Do you ever want to run a lot of bash commands and monitor them in real time as
they run parallel? Then you should try cmd-queue.


If you want to:

* Avoid heavyweight programs like slurm / airflow.

* Define the commands in either bash or Python

* Handle cases where you need to define dependencies between commands

* Execute parallel tasks in tmux sessions.

Then maybe cmd-queue is for you!



If you like:

* Code that generates code.

* Turn of all parallelism for debugging.

* Looking at your code before you run it.


Then cmd-queue is for you!
